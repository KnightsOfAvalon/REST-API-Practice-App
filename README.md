# Important Message from KnightsOfAvalon

Please note that the API key has been removed from this project. Therefore, if you are planning to try this code out for yourself, remember to change the API key to a real key. You can generate your own unique key by using the web address provided within the code. This particular API doesn't have any sensitive data, but I am practicing removing potentially sensitive data from my projects before I push them to GitHub.
